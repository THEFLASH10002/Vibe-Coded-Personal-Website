    <h2>My story</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer who thrives on solving ambiguous problems and shipping delightful experiences. I'm currently
      studying Computer Science at Howard University, specializing in software engineering, with graduation on track for
      2027. Over the past several years I've contributed to products across fintech, media, and developer tooling—driving
      impact through thoughtful architecture, strong execution, and collaborative leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I'm building APIs, crafting front-end interactions, or designing developer workflows, my goal is to create
      systems that are reliable, maintainable, and aligned with user needs.
